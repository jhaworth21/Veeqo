How to run the jhaworth.veeqo.Program:
1. clone the project to your computer
2. navigate to artifacts in the out folder
3. run the .jar file and this should launch the application


Current problems with the program:
<li>Currently doesn't correctly decode inputs not given in a format where the next character isn't a number</li>
<li>Doesn't sanitise inputs fully (e.g. code could be entered and this will through an error)</li>
<li>When referencing case automatically uses lowercase instead of asking the user which case to use</li>
